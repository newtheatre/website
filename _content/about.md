---
Based on University Park, Nottingham, we are the only student run theatre in England. We produce over 30 plays per year, across two venues (an 80-seat Auditorium and 30-seat Studio); send shows to the [National Student Drama Festival](https://www.nsdf.org.uk) and [Edinburgh Festival Fringe](http://edfringe.com); and even host our own [Student Fringe Festival]({{ site.baseurl }}/stuff/) every June.

We are part of the [University of Nottingham Students' Union]({{ site.uonsu }}) and have a membership of over 200 students every year, across a variety of courses and disciplines from English to Engineering, undergraduate and postgraduate. All of our activities are student-run and student-led, from acting, directing, and set design; to lighting, publicity, and even front of house.

The Nottingham New theatre is undergoing a modernisation program to upgrade our equipment to cutting edge, ultra energy efficent LED lighting.

This has been made possible by the wonderful donors at the Cascade Grant scheme, to whom we are incredibly grateful.

# Visiting The Theatre

We're easily accessible both by car and public transport. If you're driving you should enter University Park via the south entrance, and park in the Trent Building car park. From the car park walk up the steps at the back and a short way up the hill you'll find us on the left. The visitors' car park operate parking charges from 8:30am-4:15pm Monday-Friday, so is free for the majority of our performances.

The 34 bus takes you directly onto campus from the city centre. Alight at the Portland Hill stop and walk up the hill. You'll find us down the second road on the left.

If taking the tram, get off at the University of Nottingham stop and enter the South Entrance of campus. Walk along East Drive until you reach the Trent Building car park, walk up the steps at the back and you'll find us on the left up the hill.

# History

The history of theatre at the University of Nottingham begins in the 1920s with Dramsoc, though the building we call home wasn't created (converted from the old Engineering block) until the 60s, with raked seating and a proscenium arch installed in the 70s.

Our logo moved from swirls to two yellow squares in 2007, before moving to our beloved orange and purple in 2008. The Nottingham New Theatre brand has been tweaked and finessed over the past few years and is now consistently found on all of our publicity.

More recently, our two Studio spaces were built in 2013 and our newest season – Unscripted now known as Creatives– began in 2017.
