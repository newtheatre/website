The Nottingham New Theatre’s summer arts festival – the Student Fringe Festival (StuFF) is returning on the {% include date.html date="stuff" %}! StuFF is an annual platform for student and professional theatre makers alike to showcase their work. We’re excited to reopen this year with 18 performances across the two days ranging from stand-up to sketch comedy; from punk rock to spoken word poetry. Each show at StuFF is an hour long, at £3 a ticket, with Day and Festival passes available at £10 and £15 a person. With shows running from 11am-late on both days (Doors open for the first show at 11:30), there’s something for everyone.

### **Festival and Day Passes**

Tickets will be £3 per show, with £10 for a day pass and £15 for a festival pass.

Please note that the purchase of a festival or day pass does not guarantee entry to any given show. Passes can only be purchased in-person at the New Theatre Box Office from 11:30am each day, and individuals will be given a wristband, as well as their name being taken.

We recommend that you reserve tickets to every show that you wish to see. Passes will then grant you a free ticket to any given show. Ticket reservations can be collected from half an hour before the advertised start time, and will be released 5 minutes before the start time.
